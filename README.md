# cpp-notes

A rolling list of C++ keyword definitions and examples that I've
found to be useful.

## Links By CPP Keyword

### Explicit

> Specifies that a constructor or conversion function (since C++11)
> is explicit, that is, it cannot be used for implicit conversions 
> and copy-initialization.

- Well commented example here: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/explicit

### Final

> Specifies that a virtual function cannot be overridden in a derived
> class or that a class cannot be inherited from.

- See: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/final

### Override

> Specifies that a virtual function overrides another virtual function.

- See: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/override

### Virtual

> A virtual function a member function which is declared within
> base class and is re-defined (Overriden) by derived class. When you
> refer to a derived class object using a pointer or a reference to
> the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object
> and execute the derived classâ€™s version of the function.

  Check the `shared_ptr` section for a very good practical example of using `shared_ptr` with/outside of a class.
